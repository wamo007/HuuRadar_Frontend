        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Regular Updates:</strong> New listings are added quite frequently, so you might need to be quick to react.
        </li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold underline underline-offset-2">Cons:</h3>
      <ul className="*:py-1 lg:text-lg">
        <li>
          <strong>High Competition:</strong> Due to Funda's popularity, rental properties on Funda often attract a lot of interest, making it challenging to secure an apartment. Using HuuRadar, you may be able to contact the rent agency faster.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lack of Transparency in Pricing:</strong> Some users have reported that rental prices listed on Funda do not always match the actual prices requested by landlords or agencies. Please keep that in mind.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Direct Communication with Landlords:</strong> Funda usually redirects users to real estate agents or agencies, which can add an extra layer of bureaucracy and delay the rental process.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limited Availability in Smaller Cities:</strong> While Funda has a strong presence in major cities like Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Utrecht, it does not have the same number of the new listings in rural areas or smaller cities.

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold underline underline-offset-2">General Feedback from Users:</h3>

        <strong>Positive:</strong> Many users appreciate Funda's reliability, ease of use, and the quality of its listings. It is often considered as a starting point for housing searches.

      <p className="py-1 lg:text-lg">
        <strong>Negative:</strong> Some users express frustration with the limited rental options and the competitive nature of the platform. Foreighners (like me), in particular, find it less accommodating compared to other rental-focused websites.
      </p>
  
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold underline underline-offset-2">Conclusion:</h3>
      <p className="py-1 lg:text-lg">
        Funda is a great tool for finding apartments for rent in the Netherlands, especially if you're looking in major cities. However, due to its focus on buying and selling properties, it may not always meet the needs of renters. For a more comprehensive search, users often combine Funda with other rental platforms like Pararius, Kamernet, or HousingAnywhere.
